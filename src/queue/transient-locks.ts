// Best-effort exclusive locking against the self-host transient cache (#4013 step 1 -- extracted from
// processors.ts, first step of the file's own module-split sequence). Two lock domains are built on the same
// generic primitive here: the per-PR actuation mutex (below) and the per-(repo, PR, head SHA, mode) AI-review
// lock, which stays in processors.ts (its own extraction is a later step in the split sequence) and imports
// claimTransientLock/releaseTransientLockIfOwner/TransientLockClaim back from this module.
//
// ONE shared per-PR actuation mutex (#2129/#2135) for every mutating PR pass: the sweep/webhook-driven
// maintenance plan-and-execute, the draft-dodge close, and the reopen-reclose. These are three INDEPENDENTLY
// triggered webhook/sweep paths for the SAME PR (e.g. a `reopened` event and a concurrent `check_suite
// completed` event, or a sweep tick racing either) that can be dequeued by separate workers at nearly the same
// time; each would read its own stale-but-still-"current" state, each would pass its own freshness checks, and
// each could independently fire a mutating call for the same PR. A single lock namespace is deliberate: separate
// per-path locks (the original design) do not exclude each other, so a maintenance pass and a draft-dodge close
// could still race — the whole point of this mutex is to make "does something else already own this PR" one
// question with one answer, not one question per code path (review round 4). This is a lightweight interim
// mutex (a full per-PR Durable Object / SubmissionLock is a separate, more-involved follow-up — see the TODO in
// env.d.ts) built on the SAME transient cache used for CI-completion coalescing in processors.ts, claimed
// ATOMICALLY (see claimTransientLock) so two racing deliveries can never both win the claim — a short TTL,
// best-effort release. A lock-contended caller fails OPEN (returns false / skips this pass) rather than
// blocking — the delivery holding the lock is evaluating the SAME PR, and the periodic sweep is the backstop
// if this specific trigger is dropped. A cache adapter with no claim() primitive gets NO exclusivity at all
// (every call proceeds) rather than a get-then-set pair that only *looks* atomic — see claimTransientLock's
// doc comment for why that fallback was removed.
//
// Per-holder ownership tokens + releaseIfValue (atomic compare-and-delete) close the race a shared constant
// lock value used to leave open: a holder that ran past the TTL can never have its stale `finally` release
// delete a later claimer's live lock (#2129/#2135) — release only succeeds when the caller's own token still
// matches what's stored.

/**
 * Best-effort exclusive claim against the self-host transient cache, shared by every per-PR/per-review advisory
 * lock below. Requires the store's native atomic claim() (Redis SET NX) to provide any real exclusivity — it is
 * the only way to close the race between two concurrent callers each observing an absent key. A plain
 * get-then-set pair CANNOT close that race in general, even with an extra write-then-verify re-read: caller A
 * can write its own token, read it straight back, and return true entirely BEFORE caller B's later write/read
 * also completes and also returns true — both callers "win" (#confirmed-bug). Rather than pretend to serialize
 * via a check that silently fails under exactly the concurrent load this lock exists to guard against, an
 * adapter without claim() gets NO exclusivity from this helper: every caller proceeds. This is honest about the
 * limitation rather than a false guarantee, and costs nothing in practice — self-host's Redis-backed cache (the
 * only cache adapter this codebase ships) always implements claim(), so this is a documented limitation for a
 * hypothetical future adapter, not a live gap. A missing cache or a thrown claim() also fails OPEN (returns
 * acquired: true) — every lock built on this helper is defense-in-depth, never the primary safety gate, and
 * must never itself block real work from running.
 *
 * The claimed value is a fresh random token per call, not a shared constant (#2129/#2135): release then
 * verifies this exact token still owns the key (see releaseTransientLockIfOwner) before deleting it, so a
 * holder that runs past its TTL can never have its stale `finally` release delete a DIFFERENT, live holder's
 * claim on the same key — the race this mutex exists to close in the first place.
