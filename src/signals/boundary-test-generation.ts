// #1972 boundary-safe test generation. Detecting missing test evidence in general (test-evidence.ts) is a
// coarse, path-only signal; this module adds a NARROW, precise layer on top: does a changed diff actually
// touch one of a small set of well-known boundary-condition patterns (off-by-one array/index bounds,
// null/undefined branches, empty-collection edge cases) with NO test evidence anywhere in the same PR? Full
// test-code generation is deliberately OUT of scope (server-side generated test code would need a human to
// verify it is even correct, which risks false confidence) — this only builds a LOCAL-execution action spec
// (mirrors `local-write-tools.ts`'s pattern) that hands the contributor's OWN agent the criteria to scaffold
// tests with, so gittensory never writes code and the boundary between review and execution stays intact.
