/**
 * Duplicate-winner adjudication (#dup-winner). Flag-gated by GITTENSORY_DUPLICATE_WINNER.
 *
 * When several OPEN PRs link the same issue (a duplicate cluster), the legacy behavior gate-blocks +
 * auto-closes EVERY sibling as a duplicate — no winner survives. With the flag ON, exactly ONE winner is
 * spared: the earliest claimant. Sparse legacy rows that do not yet have claim timing fail closed so unknown
 * ordering cannot arbitrarily suppress duplicate evidence. Only the LOSERS are blocked/closed; the winner
 * still must pass CI / conflict / gate / linked-issue / slop on its OWN merits.
 *
 * This module is PURE — no IO, no Date, no random — so the same inputs always yield the same verdict and the
 * caller can compute the winner ONCE per review run and thread the result boolean consistently into every
 * surface (advisory finding, close reason, slop, panels), so they agree by construction.
 *
 * ELECTION ORDER (#dup-winner true-creation-time): prefer each PR's true GitHub `pull_request.created_at` —
 * the real order contributors opened their PRs in — over `linkedIssueClaimedAt` (gittensory's own sync-time,
 * i.e. whenever a webhook/sweep/backfill pass happened to OBSERVE the linked issue). Sync order and creation
 * order diverge whenever processing isn't strictly FIFO (a stalled sweep catching up on a backlog, backfill
 * reordering, webhook delivery delay), under the old claim-time-only rule, that divergence could crown a
 * LATER contributor the winner and close the PR of whoever actually opened first. `createdAt` is compared
 * only when BOTH sides of a given comparison have a valid one; otherwise this falls back to the legacy
 * claim-time comparison unchanged, so sparse/legacy rows keep their existing fail-closed behavior exactly.
 *
 * INVARIANT (the caller MUST honor it): {@link openSiblingNumbers} carries OPEN-only sibling PR numbers. The
 * existing sources already exclude closed/merged PRs. Once the winner closes (e.g. red CI), it leaves the open
 * set and the next-earliest OPEN claimant becomes the winner on re-eval — no permanently-orphaned cluster.
