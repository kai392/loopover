 *  closed by THIS PR as verified from GitHub's timeline (#4528, {@link isLinkedIssueTrustworthy}), can contribute
 *  labels; closing-keyword text in a PR body is author-controlled and is not authority by itself. Mirrors
 *  `resolveLinkedIssueHardRule`'s own fetch idiom (`src/review/linked-issue-hard-rules.ts`): a per-issue
 *  fetch failure contributes no labels rather than throwing, so if EVERY linked issue fails, `labels` is
 *  `[]` — which can never match a mapping, meaning a sensitive label like `gittensor:priority` never applies
 *  when its authority (the linked issue) cannot be verified. The bare `Promise.all` below is safe without a
 *  per-item `.catch` because `fetchLinkedIssueFacts` (`src/github/backfill.ts`) never throws for a network,
 *  5xx, or 404 failure -- it already wraps its own fetch in try/catch and resolves to
 *  `{status: "fetch_error"}` / `{status: "not_found"}` instead (verified by reading its implementation, not
 *  assumed); a genuinely unexpected throw there would still propagate up to this function's own caller,
 *  which is a single try/catch in `src/queue/processors.ts`'s type-label block (`type_label_error`).
 *  Callers should gate this behind `config.enabled` themselves before calling (mirrors
 *  `shouldCollectLinkedIssueEvidence`'s cheap-check-before-fetch precedent) — this function only
 *  short-circuits the zero-linked-issues case, since it has no visibility into the caller's enabled flag.
 *
 *  `mappings` (optional, #priority-linked-issue-gate-ownership) is the propagation config's own mapping
 *  list, used ONLY to know which `issueLabel`s are allowed to unlock via `resolveIssueLabelsForPropagation`'s
 *  relaxed maintainer-authored-issue path (either trust flag) -- omitting it (or a mapping never setting
 *  either flag) reproduces today's strict author-or-assignee-only behavior exactly.
 *
 *  `prMergedAt` (#4528) is this PR's own `merged_at`, or `null` while unmerged -- the caller's `pr.mergedAt`
 *  straight from the DB row (or webhook payload), no extra fetch in the common case.
 *
 *  `prNumber` (#4818, optional) unlocks ONE extra live fetch, only in the narrow ambiguous case
 *  {@link resolveIssueLabelsForPropagation} documents (a CLOSED linked issue whose closure this pass's own
 *  `prMergedAt` reads null): omitting it reproduces the pre-#4818 behavior exactly (a confirmed negative,
 *  never ambiguity-checked) -- production always passes it (`src/queue/processors.ts`'s `pr.number`).
 *
 *  Returns {@link LinkedIssuePropagationLabels} (#regression-safe-propagation), NOT a bare `string[]`:
 *  `inconclusive` is true when ANY linked issue's resolution was inconclusive (fetch failure, an errored
 *  maintainer-permission check, or an errored live-merge-state recheck), aggregated across every linked
 *  issue with a plain OR -- deliberately coarse. A caller only needs to distinguish "confirmed: no
 *  propagation applies" from "could not fully verify this pass" when `labels` came back empty; when even one
 *  linked issue resolved with real labels, those labels are just as trustworthy as before regardless of a
 *  sibling issue's fetch trouble. */
