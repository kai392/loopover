// LoopOver federated fleet intelligence (#1970) — OPT-IN, peer-to-peer calibration bundle EXPORT (#6478).
//
// This is the EXPORT side only: it packages a subset of this instance's own local calibration data into a
// signed, anonymized bundle an operator can choose to hand to a peer. It performs NO network call — the
// transport (push/pull against an operator-configured collector) is #6479, the receiving/trust-gating side is
// #6480, and the key-trust scheme is #6477's design (see the TODO on the signing key below).
//
// NOT the same thing as the #1255 orb export (src/selfhost/orb-collector.ts:155). That path is deliberately
// distinct on five axes, and this module exists precisely because none of them can be retrofitted onto it:
//   1. TRIGGER      — #1255 is ALWAYS ON once the App is configured (orb-collector.ts:6-7 "there is no opt-out
//                     flag"); its only suppressor is the ORB_AIR_GAP env var (orb-collector.ts:157). This is
//                     OPT-IN via `.loopover.yml` config-as-code, default OFF.
//   2. DESTINATION  — #1255 POSTs UP to loopover's central hosted collector (orb-collector.ts:168,
//                     https://api.loopover.ai/v1/orb/ingest). A federated bundle goes to a PEER or an operator's
//                     own collector; no central service is assumed anywhere.
//   3. GRANULARITY  — #1255 streams a watermark-paginated PER-PR event stream. This is a single AGGREGATE
//                     calibration snapshot over a window.
//   4. PRIVACY FLOOR— #1255 still carries HMAC'd repo_hash/pr_hash per event (orb-collector.ts:187-188). This
//                     carries ZERO identifiers, not even hashed ones: the aggregate query below never SELECTs
//                     an identifying column at all, so the floor is structural rather than a filtering step.
//   5. CONTENT      — #1255 exports raw per-PR verdict/outcome/reversal. This exports aggregate calibration
//                     precision plus bucketed slop/copycat rates.
//
// The precision math is REUSED from the fleet analytics (foldInstance) rather than reimplemented, deliberately:
// #6481 renders "this instance's gate precision vs the peer median", so a bundle's mergePrecision must be
// computed by the exact same confusion-matrix definition the fleet median uses, or the comparison is
// apples-to-oranges. Same reason MIN_DECIDED gates the published precision here.
