// LoopOver Orb (#1255) — fleet calibration ANALYTICS. Reads the anonymized orb_signals collected from
// self-hosted instances and derives gate-accuracy metrics across the fleet. Aggregation is median/percentile
// (never mean) so a single instance contributing fabricated data cannot move the fleet numbers.
//
// ANTI-FARMING DETECTION (#2350): gamingPatternFlags below extends the existing outlier check with a more targeted,
// ONE-SIDED signal for the specific "gaming" pattern the issue describes -- an instance mass-submitting only
// trivially-safe PRs to inflate its own merge-precision. mergePrecision alone can't distinguish "gamed" from
// "genuinely excellent" (a careful team also has high precision); combining it with UNUSUALLY HIGH volume and
// UNUSUALLY LOW reversal-rate, all three simultaneously, is the actual farming signature: lots of easy merges,
// nothing risky enough to ever get reverted. Detection only — never an automatic action.
//
// SCOPE (explicit non-goals, read before extending): this flags a self-hosted INSTANCE, never an individual
// miner. The fleet pipeline (orb_signals, review_audit's export) carries NO per-actor identity by deliberate,
// repeatedly-stated design (review_audit has no login column; predicted_gate_calibration_ledger is explicitly
// documented as never-exported, citing THIS issue as the reason) -- a genuine per-miner detector would require
// adding a new anonymized per-actor signal to the export pipeline, which is a privacy-sensitive design
// decision deserving its own focused issue/PR, not a rushed addition here. This module never deanonymizes,
// never auto-bans, and never touches the live gate — instanceId here is the SAME opaque, HMAC-derived handle
// already used everywhere else in this pipeline (see selfhost/orb-collector.ts), nothing more identifying.
//
// OUT OF SCOPE: "duplicate-claim-election win-rate skew" (isDuplicateClusterWinnerByClaim,
// src/signals/duplicate-winner.ts) is NOT implemented here. Its outcome is never persisted anywhere in this
// pipeline — only the LOSING side of a duplicate cluster produces a finding (duplicate_pr_risk), bucketed as
// gate_reasoncode_bucket="duplicate_risk" on export with no cluster id and no actor linkage. There is no
// winner marker to measure a win-rate FROM, and a per-instance duplicate_risk rate would measure something
// different (how often THIS instance's own PRs lose a local collision) than "identities farming wins," so no
// proxy for it is implemented — a misleading proxy would be worse than none.

// Exported so the federated bundle export (#1970, src/orb/federated-bundle.ts) gates its own published
// precision on the SAME volume bar the fleet median uses — a bundle must not advertise a precision the fleet
// would refuse to count.
