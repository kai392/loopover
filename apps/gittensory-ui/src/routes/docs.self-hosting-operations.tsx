      <h2>Observability profile</h2>
      <p>
        The observability profile starts Prometheus, Alertmanager, Loki, Promtail, and Grafana with
        dashboards for infra, review activity, and AI usage.
      </p>
      <p>
        When OpenTelemetry and Sentry are enabled, job audit logs and Sentry events include
        trace_id/span_id fields so an operator can jump from a failed job or issue to the matching
        trace in Grafana or Tempo.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock lang="bash" code={`docker compose --profile observability up -d`} />

      <h2>Sentry cron monitors</h2>
      <p>
        When <code>SENTRY_DSN</code> is set, the self-host runtime emits Sentry monitor check-ins
        for the recurring loops where silent stoppage matters most. Leaving <code>SENTRY_DSN</code>{" "}
        unset keeps monitor reporting off.
      </p>
      <FeatureRow
        items={[
          {
            title: "scheduled loop",
            description:
              "The two-minute maintenance tick that fans out sweeps, backfills, and refresh jobs.",

          },
        ]}
      />
      <p>
        A missed monitor means the process may still be alive but the recurring work is not checking
        in on schedule. Pair the monitor with queue depth, dead-job counts, and the structured error
        log for the same subsystem.
      </p>

      <h2>Routine checks</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Queue pending count is not growing without processing.</li>
        <li>Dead jobs stay at zero or are investigated promptly.</li>
        <li>Webhook deliveries are recent and have 2xx responses.</li>
        <li>AI usage matches expected review volume and model/effort choices.</li>
        <li>REES and RAG failures are visible and bounded.</li>
        <li>Backups are recent and restore-tested.</li>
      </ul>
