-- #personalized-calibration-ledger (PR 1 of #2349): the per-contributor gate-decision data substrate.
--
-- #2349 wants a personalized gate-prediction confidence adjustment per contributor/miner history. That needs
-- a per-actor accuracy query, but `review_audit` (migrations/0049) is DELIBERATELY actor-login-free for
-- privacy — its own migration comment states "No actor logins, no PR content, no trust/reward internals." That
-- constraint exists because `review_audit` feeds `exportOrbBatch` (src/selfhost/orb-collector.ts), an
-- anonymized cross-instance export pipeline; adding a login column there would leak actor identity into that
-- export path. This table is a SEPARATE, LOCAL-ONLY substrate — structurally a sibling of `review_audit` (one
-- row per finalized gate decision, written from the exact same call sites as `recordNativeGateDecision` in
-- src/review/parity-wire.ts), but keyed by login, and it must NEVER be wired into `exportOrbBatch` or any
-- other cross-instance/public export path.
--
-- Login (not an HMAC hash) is used deliberately: unlike `review_audit`'s cross-instance export concern, this
-- table never leaves the instance and is never rendered on any public surface (see the design-note comment at
-- the top of src/review/contributor-calibration.ts) — the same precedent `contributor_evidence` and
-- `contributor_scoring_profiles` (migrations/0004) already establish for per-login local-only data. Hashing
-- would only add a lookup-key translation step with no privacy benefit for this specific access pattern.
--
-- THIS PR ONLY POPULATES THE TABLE. Nothing reads it yet — the confidence-adjustment function that would
-- consume it (in packages/loopover-engine/src/predicted-gate.ts) is explicit follow-up work, deliberately
-- deferred so the safety-critical "a personalization adjustment must never bypass a hard blocker" invariant
-- gets its own focused review.
