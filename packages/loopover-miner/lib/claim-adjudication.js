// Soft-claim adjudication (#4291). Decides which of several miners claiming the same issue proceeds, by REUSING the
// maintainer-side duplicate-cluster election (`isDuplicateClusterWinnerByClaim` from @loopover/engine)
// rather than reimplementing it — so the miner and the maintainer gate agree on exactly one winner by construction.
//
// The local claim ledger is 100% client-side and cannot see other miners' claims, so the competing-claim signal
// must come from something publicly observable: the OPEN PRs that link the same issue (an issue with several open
// PRs linking it IS the public signal of a contested claim). The caller assembles that set — exactly like the
// maintainer-side callers in src/ do — and passes it here.
