// Real claim-conflict resolution (#4848): the missing piece over claim-adjudication.js's own adjudicator,
// which is correct and well-tested in isolation but has no caller that assembles a REAL competing-claims set.
// checkSubmissionFreshness (submission-freshness-check.js) already catches the common case pre-submission --
// aborting before open_pr if another author's PR already references the issue -- but that check can only see
// what's PUBLIC at the moment it runs. Two miners racing closely enough that BOTH pass their own freshness
// check before either's PR exists yet is a genuine TOCTOU window freshness cannot close. This module is the
// POST-submission reconciliation for exactly that window: once THIS miner's PR is real and public, check
// whether ANOTHER open PR also claims the same issue and, if this miner's claim loses the election, close its
// own just-opened PR (never anyone else's) -- the write action the contributor-vs-maintainer safety framework
// keeps maintainer-only (#4833's own scope note), since it means the autonomous loop acts on a race-resolution
// decision with no human review.
//
// CLAIM-TIME ASYMMETRY (documented, not accidental): `self`'s claimedAt is the miner's OWN real local
// claim-ledger timestamp (claim-ledger.js, recorded before work even started). A competing PR's claimedAt uses
// its real GitHub `createdAt` instead -- the maintainer gate's own duplicate-winner election uses gittensory
// server's "first observed this PR's linked-issue set" timestamp, but that requires a continuous, persistent
// observation history this stateless client-side tool does not have for a PR it doesn't own. `createdAt` is
// the best real, publicly-observable proxy available for someone else's PR -- live-issue-snapshot.js's own
// comment on `createdAt` explains this in more detail.
//
// EVENTUAL CONSISTENCY: this checks GitHub's live state immediately after submission. A competing PR that
// exists but hasn't yet propagated through GitHub's own search/GraphQL indexing in that instant would be
// invisible to this one-shot check -- there is no retry/backoff here, which would be its own separate scope.
