// Resolve `<NAME>_FILE` env vars (Docker/Swarm/K8s secret mounts) into `<NAME>` at miner startup (#5178).
// Ports src/selfhost/load-file-secrets.ts's pattern into the miner package -- the miner is a separate
// deployable (its own process/container per DEPLOYMENT.md's fleet mode), so it never runs through ORB's own
// server-startup resolver. Both modules agree on failure handling: an unreadable/missing `<NAME>_FILE`
// THROWS. The ORB analogue logs a `selfhost_secret_file_unreadable` line first and then throws the same
// way -- it converged onto this fail-fast behavior in #6284, so the divergence this comment used to
// describe no longer exists (pinned by test/unit/env-file-indirection-parity.test.ts). A broken secret
// mount therefore fails a container fast and loud, never silently proceeding with an unset/empty
// credential the next real GitHub call would then fail on anyway, with a far less specific error.
import { readFileSync } from "node:fs";

// Docker Compose's OWN reserved `_FILE`-suffixed environment variables -- never loopover's secret-file
// convention, so they must never be dereferenced below (mirrors src/selfhost/load-file-secrets.ts's own
// exclusion and rationale: `COMPOSE_FILE` is a colon-delimited list of compose file paths, never a single
// readable file itself, and `COMPOSE_ENV_FILE` points at an operator's own .env file, not a secret).

/**
 * Scan `env` for `<NAME>_FILE` vars and resolve each into `<NAME>` in place, reading the referenced file's
 * contents (trimmed). An explicit `<NAME>` value always wins over `<NAME>_FILE` (mirrors the ORB analogue's
 * precedence rule exactly) -- a `_FILE` var is only consulted when its plain counterpart is unset. Throws a
 * clear, actionable error identifying the offending `<NAME>_FILE` var and its file path when the file is
 * missing or unreadable -- this never silently leaves a credential empty/undefined. Never logs or returns any
 * resolved secret value itself; only the (non-secret) var name and file path ever appear in a thrown message.
 *
 * `env` and `readFile` are injectable purely for testability -- every real caller uses the defaults
 * (`process.env`, `node:fs`'s `readFileSync`), so this is byte-identical to a hardcoded version at runtime.
