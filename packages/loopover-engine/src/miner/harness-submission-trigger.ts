// Harness submission-gate wiring (#2337): connects the gated-submission decision function (`shouldSubmit`,
// submission-gate.ts, #2336) to the ACTUAL driving loop's own handoff signal -- iterate-loop.ts's (#2333)
// `HandoffPacket`, the exact object produced the moment a real run's self-review reaches a clean predicted-gate
// pass. This is the live actuation wiring itself: the trigger surface the safety-tier system reserves for
// maintainer review, since a bug here means an autonomous write happens when it should not have.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO: build or invoke the actual `open_pr` local-write spec (`buildOpenPrSpec`,
// `src/mcp/local-write-tools.ts`) -- that lives in the private root `src/` tree, unreachable from this
// portable package for the same cross-package-boundary reason self-review-adapter.ts's slop injection exists
// (#2334's own module doc comment). This function's OUTPUT (`allow: true`) is the gate a real call site
// (root-side server/CLI integration, wired in a later issue) consults before it builds that spec itself --
// mirrors #2336's own "gated exclusively through this function" scoping.
//
// THE SESSION-LEVEL CIRCUIT BREAKER: distinct from `shouldSubmit`'s own per-candidate signal checks
// (predicted-gate pass, slop-under-threshold), this issue's own deliverable calls for "N consecutive
// submission-gate allow:false decisions in one session pauses the run entirely pending human review, never
// silently loops trying to force a pass." Checked FIRST, before ever consulting `shouldSubmit` -- once tripped,
// no candidate can un-trip it (that requires a human clearing the session's own consecutive-block tally),
// unlike a per-candidate block which a later, different candidate can clear on its own merits.
