// Per-provider reviewer track records (#8228, epic #8211 track F). Dual-reviewer consensus events exist
// (reviewer-consensus-calibration.ts) and reversal labels now say which calls were RIGHT; this module joins
// the two: measured precision per reviewer identity, per repo and overall, over decided cases. Providers are
// opaque ids — no provider names hardcoded, no config coupling. Mirrors the consensus module's ingestion
// discipline (typed inputs, explicit vote vocabulary) and the #8085 scorer's null-below-the-sample-floor
// rule: a slice that decided nothing reports null, never 0.
//
// JOIN SEMANTICS (documented once, tested as invariants):
//   • A provider signal joins a labeled BacktestCase by exact `targetKey`. A signal whose target carries no
//     decided label is counted (`signals`) but contributes to no rate — undecided is not evidence.
//   • A provider "supported the firing" when it voted `fail` (the defect-flagging vote in the consensus
//     vocabulary). `precision` = P(label "confirmed" | this provider voted fail) — the same
//     correct-firing-as-numerator discipline as computeRulePrecision, at reviewer grain.
//   • `agreementRate` = share of this provider's decided votes that MATCHED the human label (fail↔confirmed,
//     pass/warn↔reversed) — a symmetric accuracy measure precision alone can't give a rarely-failing provider.
//   • `consensusRate` = share of this provider's signals on targets that another provider ALSO reviewed
//     where the two votes agreed (both-fail or both-non-fail); `splitRate` is its complement. Null when the
//     provider shares no targets — one-provider corpora have no consensus to measure.
//
// Same purity contract as the rest of this module family: no IO, no randomness, no wall-clock reads.
